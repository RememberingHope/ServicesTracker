# SPED Services Tracking Suite

A comprehensive suite of applications for tracking Special Education (SPED) and Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) services in educational settings.

## 🎯 Overview

This suite consists of four interconnected applications designed to streamline service tracking, data collection, and reporting:

1. **QR Code Maker** - Creates encrypted QR codes for quick service entry
2. **Services Tracker** - Touchscreen kiosk app for logging services via QR scanning
3. **Services Aggregator** - Collects service data from multiple sources via email
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Interactive data visualization with pivot tables and charts

## 🚀 Quick Start - One-Click Setup

### Easiest Method: Automated Setup

1. **Download this project**:
   - Click the green "Code" button above → "Download ZIP"
   - Or clone: `git clone https://github.com/RememberingHope/ServicesTracker.git`

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```batch
   setup.bat
   ```

3. **That's it!** The setup script will:
   - ✅ Check for Python (install if needed)
   - ✅ Install all dependencies automatically
   - ✅ Build all executables
   - ✅ Place them in the `dist\` folder

### What You Get

After setup completes, you'll find in the `dist\` folder:
- `ServicesTracker.exe` - Deploy to classroom kiosks
- `QRCodeMaker.exe` - For administrators
- `ServicesAggregator.exe` - For data collection

To run the Analytics Dashboard:
```batch
run_dashboard.bat
```

### Manual Setup (Advanced Users)

## 🖥️ Deployment Guide

### Classroom Kiosk Setup
1. Copy `ServicesTracker.exe` to kiosk computer
2. Configure on first run:
   - Set PIN (must match QR codes)
   - Configure email settings (SMTP)
3. Create desktop shortcut
4. Optional: Set to auto-start with Windows

### Administrator Setup
1. Copy `QRCodeMaker.exe` and `ServicesAggregator.exe` to admin computer
2. Use QR Code Maker to create service cards
3. Use Services Aggregator to collect data from emails
4. Run `run_dashboard.bat` for analytics

## 🔒 Security Features

- **PIN-based encryption** for QR codes (prevents unauthorized scanning)
- **Local data storage** before transmission
- **Secure credential storage** using Windows Credential Manager
- **Duplicate detection** to prevent data redundancy
- **PBKDF2 key derivation** for enhanced security

## 📊 Analytics Dashboard

The Streamlit-based dashboard provides:
- Interactive pivot tables
- Student progress tracking
- Service delivery heatmaps
- Goal achievement metrics
- Compliance reporting
- Data export capabilities

To run the dashboard:
```batch
run_dashboard.bat
```
Then open http://localhost:8501 in your browser

## 🛠️ Building Individual Components

If you only need to rebuild specific applications:

```batch
build_tracker.bat      # Services Tracker only
build_qr_maker.bat     # QR Code Maker only
build_aggregator.bat   # Services Aggregator only
```

## 📋 System Requirements

### For Running Executables
- Windows 10 or later
- Webcam (for Services Tracker QR scanning)
- Internet connection (for email features)

### For Building from Source
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 500MB free disk space
- Administrator rights NOT required with WinPython

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Antivirus Warnings
Windows Defender may flag the executables. This is common with PyInstaller apps.
- Add to Windows Defender exclusions
- Or build from source yourself for trust

### Camera Not Working
- Check camera permissions in Windows Settings
- Ensure no other app is using the camera
- Try unplugging and reconnecting USB camera

### Build Failures
1. Run `clean_build.bat` to remove old files
2. Update PyInstaller: `pip install --upgrade pyinstaller`
3. Ensure all dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
